    EV- short acronym for "electric vehicle".



        Okay, so you are considering about buying an EV, but you don't know if you should buy one or not. I will tell you some factors you should consider to help you decide and get a better understanding of EVs.
The factors are simple, but can be challenging to decide if the pros and cons are worth it. I wouldn't waste your time, so here are the factors: <strong>range and battery life, cost, savings, features, charging speed, charging network,
and company</strong>. I listed them from the most important to the least important, but the first three are controversial, it really just depends on how much you travel.


<h2>Range and Battery Life, Why Most Won't Buy</h2>
<p>
    So, here are the two most important cons to consider before even looking at the price of a ev. Lets talk about range first. <strong>Range</strong> is simple, its how far a vehicle can travel without having to recharge or refuel. In May 2021, the
Nissan Leaf(minimum) has a range around 149 miles compared to the Tesla Model 3(minimum) which has about 263 miles. Maximum ranges for an ev go around 390 miles(May 2021) to 500 miles(end of 2021). See if this range is suitable for you,
meaning you can go for a day without any interruptions when charging the ev. Charging times can take from 30 minutes to 12 hours depending on the charging adapter level, I will talk more about this later. Next is <strong>Battery life</strong>, which
basically is the amount of times a battery can be recharged without damaging the battery. Don't freak out, this isn't as bad as it sounds. Basically, for every battery cycle, the batteries original capacity goes down. But, the good thing is, ev
batteries are high tech. Tesla's new batteries last for about 1 million miles, and they give you advice to charge your battery so it lasts longer. To understand it more, here is a YouTube video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3we1e56ib0o">More info</a>. Don't worry though, the more you take
care of your battery, the longer it will last. Just research more about the battery life of the car you want, so you can see if it has a long battery life or not.
</p>
    <h2>Cost, Too High for Some</h2>

<p>
    The other con, and the last con for me, is the price of an ev. Since it takes a lot of money to build the battery, evs can get a little expensive. You can buy a more luxurious gas car for the same price. This makes people
not want to buy an ev. Elon Musk and other CEOs are trying to fix that. That's pretty much what I have for the price of an ev, but keep in mind that ev prices are going to decrease in the future, and might even beat gas cars.
</p>

    <h2>Savings, What can Help With the Cost</h2>
<P>
    This might make you reconsider about the fact an ev is too costly for you. There are three ways you can save money with an ev: <strong>fuel, federal grants and maintenance</strong>. Lets talk about <strong>maintenance</strong> first. An ev really doesn't
need <strong>maintenance</strong> like a gas car. An average Tesla Model 3 needs about $1,490 for 5 years(source: <a href="https://www.motor1.com/reviews/406938/tesla-maintenance-cost/">https://www.motor1.com/reviews/406938/tesla-maintenance-cost/</a>). This is good compared with $8,500 per year on a gas car.
<strong>Grants</strong> are common when buying a ev. You get a federal grant and a state grant. Check with your state to see if they will provide you with a state grant. States will also have electricity bonuses if you buy an ev. Alabama, for example,
will install a free ev charger in your home and give lower electricity cost for certain hours. Lastly, <strong>fuel</strong> for an ev is cheaper than for a gas car. Ev cost about $21.60 per month(average) for fuel. A gas car cost about
$72.10/month(average) for fuel. Those are the savings of an ev that can make it cheaper to buy since it's cheaper to own.
</P>

    <h2>Features, The Cool Part About Evs</h2>
<p>
    If features don't matter to you, skip this paragraph and move onto the next, but depending on the brand and the model, there are cool features evs have. Tesla Model S has autopilot for extra $10k, one of the best noise canceling in
the industry, 1.9 second acceleration, 17in screen in the front, 8in screen in the back, all glass roof, quiet motors, 360 camera recording(while driving and while parked if triggered), and a frunk. The screen can also do many cool things.
The screen controls the car, lets you play games and watch movies, surf the web, etc. The Model 3 also has some of these features as well. Lucid Air delivers a Mercedes competitive luxury vehicle. These are some examples of features you
should look for when buying a ev. These features are what makes evs attractive to most people, so compare different cars at your price range and car range to see which ev has the best features.
</p>

    <h2>Charging Speed, Why Going on Trips With an Ev Can Get Annoying</h2>
<p>
    I briefly discussed this one in "range and battery life". A home charger takes about 8 to 12 hours, but you can charge at night, so this isn't really an issue. A supercharger takes about 30 minutes to charge up an ev. The charging speed
mainly depends on the size of the battery and the charging station level. It's not a big deal if you don't travel a lot. Companies are also trying to decrease the charging times of evs, so waiting might be a good idea if the charging time gets
in your way. Research more about the charging time of your car to see if it has a long or short charging time.
</p>

    <h2>Charging Network, How Tesla is Ahead</h2>
<p>
    The charging network is what keeps evs good for long trips if the owner is willing to wait for it to charge. Tesla has the largest charging network in the world. They let other ev manufactures use it, but some manufactures don't let Tesla's
superchargers to charge their cars. But a adapter should do the trick and make it chargeable with Tesla's huge charging network. Most evs also put pit stops where their manufactures chargers are when you are going on a long trip. To make it do that,
use the map services provided by the ev to enter your destination.
</p>

    <h2>Company, What You Should Check Last</h2>
<p>
    The company or manufacture is the last thing you should check, and this is also <strong>optional</strong>. The company factor is to see the <strong>quality of it, customer service, and repair speed</strong>. The company quality means in my terms is
how much effort it puts in to make you have the best experiences of your car. For example, apr is good, care reliability is good for the company, and see if they have a service center in their dealership. The second is customer service. Tesla,
for example, has great customer service, they will give you a loaner car while your car is out for repair, take care of you when you enter their dealerships, and let you play around their car and even let you play music out loud from their display car.
Lastly, the repair speed of the car can be a con for some companies. Again, I'm going to use Tesla for an example. Tesla needs to send the repair shop most of the parts, and since Tesla still struggles to do this fast, it takes around 4 weeks to get those
parts from Tesla and repair your car. The repair can also be expensive with all the sensors and other electronics in the car. Just be careful when you are driving, and if you do crash, make sure you save the tesla's footage to show to law enforcement and
your insurance if it wasn't your fault.:)
</p>

    <h2>Bonus, Lets Just Call It That</h2>
<p>
    Electric cars usually come with a <strong>5-star rating</strong>. Yes, they will protect you from crash better than a Mercedes S class for a fraction of the price. Check the youtube channel Wham Bamm TeslaCam for proof. Here is a video of a Tesla crash,
the car got totaled, but the driver was harmless. The video: <a href="https://youtu.be/3eaD4rUol0k?t=7">Wham Baam TeslaCam</a>. This is why a decent ev will have a 5-star safety: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/04/watch-how-tesla-model-3-earned-its-5-star-safety-rating-from-euro-ncap/">website</a>. If akk these pros
don't make you happy think that you are doing a good deed to the environment when buying an ev.
</p>

    <h2>Soo......</h2>
<p>
    It's a little risky, so ask yourself this question: "Do I want to take the risk?" If not, just wait 10 more years. If yes, I recommend buying one now. Thank you for reading this, and I hope that I helped you make your decision!
